# Spam Filter using NLP

Welcome to my Spam Filter project, a ML (machine learning) based Natural Language Processing (NLP) project. In this project, I have developed a spam filter that uses machine learning techniques to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages. This readme will provide an in-depth overview of my project, highlighting the key aspects and techniques of the project.

## Project Overview:

Spam emails are a persistent problem in today's digital world. Machine learning and NLP techniques offer effective solutions to combat this issue. This project is dedicated to the creation of a spam filter using a variety of ML / NLP methods.

## Key Topics Covered

### Data Cleaning:

One of the initial and crucial steps in this project is data cleaning. We preprocess the raw data, removing irrelevant information, fixing inconsistencies, and ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical phase in understanding the characteristics of the dataset. We use visualizations and statistical methods to gain insights into the structure and distribution of the data.

### Feature Engineering:

Feature engineering is the process of creating relevant features from the raw data. In this project, we design features that help in distinguishing spam from legitimate messages.

### Outlier Detection:

Detecting outliers in the dataset is essential for maintaining the integrity of the model. Outliers can have a significant impact on model performance and must be handled appropriately.

### Tokenization:

Tokenization is a fundamental NLP technique. We break down text data into individual tokens, which are the building blocks for certain NLP processes.

### Removing Stopwords:

Stopwords are common words that do not carry significant meaning in text analysis. Removing them helps reduce "noise" in the data.

### Lemmatization:

Lemmatization involves reducing words to their base or root form. This process helps in standardizing text and improving the quality of features.

### Model Building:

The heart of the project involves building machine learning models. We employ various algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to develop an effective spam filter.

### Model Evaluation:

Model evaluation is a critical step in assessing the performance of the spam filter. Metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy are used to measure the effectiveness of the models.

### Libraries and Tools:

To implement these NLP and ML techniques, we utilized several tools and libraries, including:
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and model development.
- **Sci-Kit Learn**: A powerful machine learning library that provides tools for nlp, classification, and other amazing ML tasks.
- **Matplotlib**: A popular library for creating data visualizations.
- **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit): A comprehensive library for NLP tasks.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental library for numerical operations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: A data visualization library that works well with Pandas data structures.

## Usage:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions.
- Train and evaluate the spam filter model.
